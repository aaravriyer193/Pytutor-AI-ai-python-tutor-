PyTutor was made possible thanks to the following technologies, resources, and communities:

---

## Core Technologies

* **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)** – Provides the conversational AI that powers the tutor.
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – The foundation of the PyTutor front-end.
* **[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)** – Used for making API requests from the browser.

---

## Inspiration & Learning

* The global **open source community** for countless tutorials, blog posts, and snippets that helped guide development.
* **Educators and coding mentors** whose approaches inspired the teaching tone of PyTutor.
* **Students and self-learners** who tested the early builds and gave feedback on clarity and usability.

## Future Enhancements Acknowledgments

* **[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)** and **[Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/)** – Potential integrations for running real Python in the browser.
* **[Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)** – Possible library for syntax highlighting in future versions.
